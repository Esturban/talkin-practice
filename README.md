> If a coach says I miss practice, and y'all hear it, then that's that. I might've missed one practice this year, but if somebody says 'He doesn't come to practice,' it could be one practice out of all the practices this year, that's enough. I told Coach Brown that you don't have to give the people of Philadelphia a reason to think about trading me or anything like that. If you trade somebody, you trade them to make the team better...simple as that. I'm cool with that. I'm all about that. The people in Philadelphia deserve to have a winner. It's simple as that. It goes further than that.
